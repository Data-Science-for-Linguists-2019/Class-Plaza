# To-do 10: Past Project Critiques

## Na-Rae the fake student
- Project 1: [Document Clustering](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering) by Dan Zheng
   - Strength: has a lot of code
   - Possible improvement: need more code
   - One thing I learned: providing [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering/blob/master/requirements.txt) along with installation instruction for future guests was a great idea. It streamlines `pip` installation.  

- Project 2: some other project

## John the real student
- Project 1: [2016 Election Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/2016-Election-Project)
	- Strength: Clean code, lots of good explanations (also super 
detailed and organized analysis)
	- Improvement: Term "professional" unclear in presentation until 
the end, would have liked more of the "process" in the presentation
	- Thing I learned: How to modify NER trees

- Project 2: [Dogs vs. Cat Neologisms on Twitter](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter)
	- Strength: Really interesting concept, fun presentation, clear 
code
	- Improvement: Incorporating a way to read images (lots of memes 
out there), is limited in what terms it uses
	- Thing I learned: More methods of handling Tweepy and DFs!
