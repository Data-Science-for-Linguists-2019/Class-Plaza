# To-do 10: Past Project Critiques

## Na-Rae the fake student
- Project 1: [Document Clustering](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering) by Dan Zheng
   - Strength: has a lot of code
   - Possible improvement: need more code
   - One thing I learned: providing [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Document_Clustering/blob/master/requirements.txt) along with installation instruction for future guests was a great idea. It streamlines `pip` installation.  

- Project 2: some other project

## John the real student
- Project 1: [2016 Election Project](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/2016-Election-Project)
	- Strength: Clean code, lots of good explanations (also super 
detailed and organized analysis)
	- Improvement: Term "professional" unclear in presentation until 
the end, would have liked more of the "process" in the presentation
	- Thing I learned: How to modify NER trees

- Project 2: [Dogs vs. Cat Neologisms on Twitter](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter)
	- Strength: Really interesting concept, fun presentation, clear 
code
	- Improvement: Incorporating a way to read images (lots of memes 
out there), is limited in what terms it uses
	- Thing I learned: More methods of handling Tweepy and DFs!

## Cassie the Metaphysical Student
- Project 1: [Dogs vs Cats on 
Twitter](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Dog_vs_Cat_Neologisms_on_Twitter) 
by Margaret Jones
	- Strength: The LIVE_data_collection jupyter notebook file is a 
great way for people looking at her repo to get a good, hands-on way to 
understand her project by letting them try out code themselves.
	- Improvement: Counting retweets and favorites seems more like a 
general statistical analysis than a linguistic analysis. Is there a way 
to focus more on the neologism trends? Also, since data was collected 
over time, and trends varied based on when data was collected, it would 
be interesting to see a time plot of retweet and favorite trends, 
instead of just individual pie charts and bar graphs.
	- Thing I learned: Twitter can be really restrictive on scraping 
data from tweets and publishing data! What tweets Twitter gives you 
access to is an important consideration when doing any kind of twitter 
analysis.
- Project 2: [NYT Sentiment 
Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/NYT_Figures_Sentiment_Analysis) 
by Christopher Lagunilla
	- Strength: Really well organized/navigable! They included and 
clearly labeled old/abandoned code even though their final project ended 
up going a different direction. Past/failed attempts can 
be just as informative as successes! This lets visitors to the repo see 
what not to do, or let them attempt an approach Christopher decided not to 
take.
	- Improvement: The project could discuss a bit more about how 
VADER works, to get a better idea of what the program is looking for 
when classifying sentiment.
	- Thing I learned: how to unpack xml files and use regular 
expressions with glob to find specific tags. Also, this introduced me to 
the sentiment analyzer VADER!
