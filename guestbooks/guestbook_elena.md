# ESL Article Acquisition

Ciao! You can find my project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/ESL-Article-Acquisition). I have a few files in my exploratory data analysis folder, so if you want a quick and dirty explanation of what's what/where things are, you can go to my progress report [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/ESL-Article-Acquisition/blob/master/progress_report.md).

Edit: Sorry, I forgot I made some updates to the BALC_clean.ipynb file, which are clearly labeled. The updates aren't as polished as the rest of the file, just an FYI. You can poke around if you like, but I just wanted to give that warning.

Question: Why did the cowboy get a dachshund?

* **One Thing I Liked:** Good in depth look at your data and its 
inconsistencies!Your code gives a clear outline of what your corpus 
looks like and what flaws there are in its data. This makes the 
motivation behind using /total/ totally clear! Also, really good use of 
regular expressions to clean up your data!
* **One Area of Improvement:** What's your motivation behind your 3 
hypotheses at the bottom of your project plan file? In your summary, you 
briefly explain how articles work in Arabic, Spanish, and Korean, but 
this might not make reasons for your hypotheses clear to readers, 
especially people who aren't familiar with those languages.
* **One Thing I Learned:** At the bottom of your clean-up file, you use 
something called SpellChecker from a package called spellchecker. I 
didn't know there was a python package for that, but I'm not suprised 
either. Ah, the wonders of python!
