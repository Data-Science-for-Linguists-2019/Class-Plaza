# ESL Article Acquisition

Ciao! You can find my project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/ESL-Article-Acquisition). I have a few files in my exploratory data analysis folder, so if you want a quick and dirty explanation of what's what/where things are, you can go to my progress report [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/ESL-Article-Acquisition/blob/master/progress_report.md).

Edit: Sorry, I forgot I made some updates to the BALC_clean.ipynb file, which are clearly labeled. The updates aren't as polished as the rest of the file, just an FYI. You can poke around if you like, but I just wanted to give that warning.

Question: Why did the cowboy get a dachshund?
