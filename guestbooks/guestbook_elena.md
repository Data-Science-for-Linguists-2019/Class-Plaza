# ESL Article Acquisition

Ciao! You can find my project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/ESL-Article-Acquisition). I have a few files in my exploratory data analysis folder, so if you want a quick and dirty explanation of what's what/where things are, you can go to my progress report [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/ESL-Article-Acquisition/blob/master/progress_report.md).
