### Eva's entries
- __What was done well:__ Your project idea is really cool! It looks like it was difficult loading the corpus as XML files - good job turning it into a really readable dataframe.
- __Improvements and suggestions:__
 - __Analysis:__ You could add some headers and markdown sections in your Jupyter notebook files so readers know what you're doing in each step. Some of the words in the Middle English dataframe look very similar to Modern English words, and some of them look super unfamiliar - it would be helpful to add the Modern English translation, and maybe some background info on Middle English verb conjugations too.
 - __Formatting stuff:__ Your markdown doesn't seem to be formatted correctly on some pages. Remember to put a space between heading/bullet point markers and before the text. On your project_plan page, you could put a citation or a link to the article that you reference.
- __What I learned:__ Middle English verb endings look pretty different from modern English verb endings! I'm interested to see some of the patterns you uncover.
