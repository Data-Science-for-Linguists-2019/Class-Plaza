Hope you enjoy and that this brings you some warmth on these freezing days.

Note: I had some problems with the encoding of my files, so I have been chunking it out for the past few days and will update my file over break when I have less noise going on.

### Eva's entries
- __What was done well:__ Really great comments and organization - you really walk the reader through your write-up and thoroughly explain what you're doing in each step and why. Your project plan and progress reports are helpful and well-organized.
- __Improvements and suggestions:__ It would be good to include some background on syntax/word order in Persian further down the line, maybe in your final presentation. I am interested in how this relates to the quality of subtitle translation - do some Persian sentences just mimic English syntax exactly, even if it makes no sense? Since you mention English idioms in your project plan, it might be worthwhile to add a column to your dataframe to indicate if the sentence is +/- idiom and compare between the groups. There might be an already existing list of English idioms you could use. I wish I had a suggestion for your encoding issues :(
- __What I learned:__ It was cool to learn more about translation and some of the issues involved in translating from Persian to English specifically. I learned more about parsing XML files (though I still don't totally understand). 

#### Thank you Eva!
I will definitely look into creating a [+/- idiom] column -- that's a great idea! And yes; I will most definitely include more about Persian in the future.
