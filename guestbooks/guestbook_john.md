Hope you enjoy and that this brings you some warmth on these freezing days.

Note: I had some problems with the encoding of my files, so I have been chunking it out for the past few days and will update my file over break when I have less noise going on.

### Eva's entries
- __What was done well:__ Really great comments and organization - you really walk the reader through your write-up and thoroughly explain what you're doing in each step and why. Your project plan and progress reports are helpful and well-organized.
- __Improvements and suggestions:__ It would be good to include some background on syntax/word order in Persian further down the line, maybe in your final presentation. I am interested in how this relates to the quality of subtitle translation - do some Persian sentences just mimic English syntax exactly, even if it makes no sense? Since you mention English idioms in your project plan, it might be worthwhile to add a column to your dataframe to indicate if the sentence is +/- idiom and compare between the groups. There might be an already existing list of English idioms you could use. I wish I had a suggestion for your encoding issues :(
- __What I learned:__ It was cool to learn more about translation and some of the issues involved in translating from Persian to English specifically. I learned more about parsing XML files (though I still don't totally understand). 

#### Thank you Eva!
I will definitely look into creating a [+/- idiom] column -- that's a great idea! And yes; I will most definitely include more about Persian in the future.

### Cassie's entry (3/26/19)
- **What I Like:** What an interesting project! You did great research 
on different potential parsers to use, and your organization in your 
jupyter notebook makes your code/line of thinking very easy to follow! 
Also, great job at acknowledging where you're having trouble and citing 
resources you used to tackle these issues.
- **What Can Be Improved:** I agree with Eva--some background on how 
English and Persian syntax differ would be helpful. This info could 
help explain the approaches you'll take during your analysis portion. 
You mention similes in English...is simile structure usually different 
in Persian? Also, don't be so hard on yourself! You have a very 
interesting, very impressive project--even if you're not as far as 
you'd like, you've made lots of progress.
- **What I Learned:** That sometimes Windows computers aren't the best, 
and Colab can be a good way to run code that the computer can't deal 
with. Also, I've never used XML parsing, so this was a nice look at how 
xml file processing works.
