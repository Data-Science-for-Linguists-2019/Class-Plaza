Hope you enjoy and that this brings you some warmth on these freezing days.

Note: I had some problems with the encoding of my files, so I have been chunking it out for the past few days and will update my file over break when I have less noise going on.

### Eva's entries
- __What was done well:__ Really great comments and organization - you really walk the reader through your write-up and thoroughly explain what you're doing in each step and why. Your project plan and progress reports are helpful and well-organized.
- __Improvements and suggestions:__ It would be good to include some background on syntax/word order in Persian further down the line, maybe in your final presentation. I am interested in how this relates to the quality of subtitle translation - do some Persian sentences just mimic English syntax exactly, even if it makes no sense? Since you mention English idioms in your project plan, it might be worthwhile to add a column to your dataframe to indicate if the sentence is +/- idiom and compare between the groups. There might be an already existing list of English idioms you could use. I wish I had a suggestion for your encoding issues :(
- __What I learned:__ It was cool to learn more about translation and some of the issues involved in translating from Persian to English specifically. I learned more about parsing XML files (though I still don't totally understand).

#### Thank you Eva!
I will definitely look into creating a [+/- idiom] column -- that's a great idea! And yes; I will most definitely include more about Persian in the future.

### Cassie's entry (3/26/19)
- **What I Like:** What an interesting project! You did great research
on different potential parsers to use, and your organization in your
jupyter notebook makes your code/line of thinking very easy to follow!
Also, great job at acknowledging where you're having trouble and citing
resources you used to tackle these issues.
- **What Can Be Improved:** I agree with Eva--some background on how
English and Persian syntax differ would be helpful. This info could
help explain the approaches you'll take during your analysis portion.
You mention similes in English...is simile structure usually different
in Persian? Also, don't be so hard on yourself! You have a very
interesting, very impressive project--even if you're not as far as
you'd like, you've made lots of progress.
- **What I Learned:** That sometimes Windows computers aren't the best,
and Colab can be a good way to run code that the computer can't deal
with. Also, I've never used XML parsing, so this was a nice look at how
xml file processing works.

- **What I Like:** Your thought process and workflow is really comprehensive and easy to walk through and understand. You also clearly did a lot of work -- lots of trips to OH and looking into different parsers and chunkers. I know you haven't accomplished as much as you originally wanted to at this point, but it's clear that you put in a lot of work to get to this point! Good job so far.
- **What Can Be Improved:** Like Eva and Cassie said -- a little bit more information on Persian and how it differs in syntax and your target structure would be helpful. As far as removing non-communicative acts from the data, have you considered throwing out sentences for which the Persian or English length is under a certain point? This will probably get rid of some actual speech in subtitles, but under a certain point, I don't think you'll be gleaning very much anyway based on your interest in similies. You could also pick certain idioms in either English and/or Persian to focus on (which will narrow down your search considerably). You could also tie in the structure of idioms in Persian (if there is a certain structure) and target chunks or text that has that specific structure. Not sure if any of this is helpful, but I think it might narrow down what you have to process and analyze.
- **What I Learned:** There are chunkers in Python! It makes sense, since people have done a lot of parsing and annotating in the past. But I never thought to look. Very neat.

### Patrick's visit 4.2.2019
- __What I like:__ The data seems to be really well processed and your code is well explained.
- __Areas of improvement:__ As other people have said, some additional info on Persian would be useful.
_ __What I learned:__ POS tagging and chunking in Python. Also, processing data from XML to a more useable form.

- **What I Like:** Your project's goal is very clear. I like your idea and your work is easy to understand. I know it is not easy to combine all these modules together in one file, but I am really looking forward to the result you will achieve. Good job.
- **What Can Be Improved:** More explanation about Persian will be helpful. Because I have no idea about Persian, if you can create some categories to tell Persian syntax, it can let your audience know more.
- **What I Learned:** POS-tagging and chunking the text. I may employ these methods into my project to help me do more analysis. That's helpful.
