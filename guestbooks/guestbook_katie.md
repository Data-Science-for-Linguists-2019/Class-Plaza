- *What was done well*: Your data was very thoroughly explored and modified in a logical way! Your files and notebooks are super easy to navigate. That Fitocracy data (a program that I've never heard of) stuck out to me as super helpful for your project. 
- *What can be improved*: Your data appears to have a few skews to it that might bias your conclusions for your first goal in a few different ways. I was thinking possibly taking a random (yet proportional) sample of the data, or doing something along those lines. For example, the FB data appears consist of a many posts by a few (relatively) people. I don't know how exactly to approach this -- or if it's even a problem in the first place -- but I figured I'd point it out. For your ML goal, though, this shouldn't be a problem.
- *One thing I learned*: The use of the .nunique() function was very cool and I'm definitely going to use that in the future for my own project. (also I was a _little_ surprised by how male-dominated Ted Talk responses were at the time this data was collected).
Keep up the awesome work!!! I really look forward to seeing where this project travels.
