### John's Entries:
- *What was done well*: Your data was very thoroughly explored and modified in a logical way! Your files and notebooks are super easy to navigate. That Fitocracy data (a program that I've never heard of) stuck out to me as super helpful for your project. 
- *What can be improved*: Your data appears to have a few skews to it that might bias your conclusions for your first goal in a few different ways. I was thinking possibly taking a random (yet proportional) sample of the data, or doing something along those lines. For example, the FB data appears consist of a many posts by a few (relatively) people. I don't know how exactly to approach this -- or if it's even a problem in the first place -- but I figured I'd point it out. For your ML goal, though, this shouldn't be a problem.
- *One thing I learned*: The use of the .nunique() function was very cool and I'm definitely going to use that in the future for my own project. (also I was a _little_ surprised by how male-dominated Ted Talk responses were at the time this data was collected).
Keep up the awesome work!!! I really look forward to seeing where this project travels.


### John's Second Entries:
- *What waas done well*: As expected, everything looks great! No corner was left unturned. I really enjoyed the visualizations of your data as well -- they really aided in my understanding of 
what you were working with. Oh, and nice choice of license! I think the MIT license fits your project perfectly.
- *What can be improved*: I could use more explanation of your data, perhaps indicating trends or possible conclusions. You have all the numbers and statistics ready, but it would be 
interesting to see what conclusions might be able to be drawn from this.
- *One thing I learned*: Using > and < to sort your DFs (see Output 32). That makes a lot of sense when working with numerical data, and I'm definitely interested in seeing if I can apply this 
method to my project.
