# Gender Dynamics in Animated Movie Dialogue

Explore my project
[here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue)!

So far, my project is mostly data organization, and right now my data
really resembles a hydra (each time I fix one
problem in my data, three more rear their ugly heads).

Any and all feedback is really appreciated!!!!


## Ting-Wei

* Strength: Interesting topic and nice data cleaning. Clear project explanation.
* Improvement: Shorten the length of jupyter notebook, and keep the main point.
* Thing I learned: I never think about that we can detect the gender of movie characters by their dialogue. It is really interesting to me. I learned a lot of data cleaning methods from this project.

- **One thing I liked** : Wow you watched Moana and typed all the lines in? Nice lol. Overall, I like your plan and your code seems well written.
- **One area of improvement** : Why'd you get rid of Lion King? There isn't a princess but there's Nala. Also, imo you may want to consider how significant the messiness of the disney corpus is. Your data will never be perfect, and it may not be worth the time and effort to go through all of the data and fix everything, depending on how messy it is. Just something to think about.
- **One thing I learned** : A method to create a dataframe of lines of speech from a movie script.
