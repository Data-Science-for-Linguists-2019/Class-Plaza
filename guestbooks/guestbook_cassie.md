# Gender Dynamics in Animated Movie Dialogue

Explore my project
[here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue)!

So far, my project is mostly data organization, and right now my data
really resembles a hydra (each time I fix one
problem in my data, three more rear their ugly heads).

Any and all feedback is really appreciated!!!!


## Ting-Wei

* Strength: Interesting topic and nice data cleaning. Clear project explanation.
* Improvement: Shorten the length of jupyter notebook, and keep the main point.
* Thing I learned: I never think about that we can detect the gender of movie characters by their dialogue. It is really interesting to me. I learned a lot of data cleaning methods from this project.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for visiting Ting-Wei! I agree, I can definitely shorten up some 
of my notebooks/clean up their organization! I might split a few up to 
make them more readable.

- **One thing I liked** : Wow you watched Moana and typed all the lines in? Nice lol. Overall, I like your plan and your code seems well written.
- **One area of improvement** : Why'd you get rid of Lion King? There isn't a princess but there's Nala. Also, imo you may want to consider how significant the messiness of the disney corpus is. Your data will never be perfect, and it may not be worth the time and effort to go through all of the data and fix everything, depending on how messy it is. Just something to think about.
- **One thing I learned** : A method to create a dataframe of lines of speech from a movie script.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for visit, Patrick! I took your advice to heart when prepping my 
second project report. I can't fix ALL the data, so I ended up only 
fixing issues as I came across them during my annotation processes.  

### Katie
- **One thing I liked** : Such a cool topic! I also like how you really walk through the code so we can understand your process and what's going on. I'm also impressed by how much work goes into the cleaning of the data.
- **One area of improvement** : Will you be doing any machine learning? I understand why you wouldn't, since your task is already so huge! But if you do, an easy(/ier) one would be identifying the gender of the speaker.
- **One thing I learned** : The use of the "partial" function was interesting! A cool way to reuse code.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for the visit, Katie! I like the idea of using machine learning 
to identify gender. If I have time to do this after my other work, I 
will definitely try it out!
