# Gender Dynamics in Animated Movie Dialogue

Explore my project
[here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue)!

So far, my project is mostly data organization, and right now my data
really resembles a hydra (each time I fix one
problem in my data, three more rear their ugly heads).

Any and all feedback is really appreciated!!!!


## Ting-Wei

* Strength: Interesting topic and nice data cleaning. Clear project explanation.
* Improvement: Shorten the length of jupyter notebook, and keep the main point.
* Thing I learned: I never think about that we can detect the gender of movie characters by their dialogue. It is really interesting to me. I learned a lot of data cleaning methods from this project.
