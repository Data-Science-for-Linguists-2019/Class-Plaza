# Gender Dynamics in Animated Movie Dialogue

Explore my project
[here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Animated-Movie-Gendered-Dialogue)!

So far, my project is mostly data organization, and right now my data
really resembles a hydra (each time I fix one
problem in my data, three more rear their ugly heads).

Any and all feedback is really appreciated!!!!


## Ting-Wei

* Strength: Interesting topic and nice data cleaning. Clear project explanation.
* Improvement: Shorten the length of jupyter notebook, and keep the main point.
* Thing I learned: I never think about that we can detect the gender of movie characters by their dialogue. It is really interesting to me. I learned a lot of data cleaning methods from this project.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for visiting Ting-Wei! I agree, I can definitely shorten up some 
of my notebooks/clean up their organization! I might split a few up to 
make them more readable.

### Patrick 
- **One thing I liked** : Wow you watched Moana and typed all the lines in? Nice lol. Overall, I like your plan and your code seems well written.
- **One area of improvement** : Why'd you get rid of Lion King? There isn't a princess but there's Nala. Also, imo you may want to consider how significant the messiness of the disney corpus is. Your data will never be perfect, and it may not be worth the time and effort to go through all of the data and fix everything, depending on how messy it is. Just something to think about.
- **One thing I learned** : A method to create a dataframe of lines of speech from a movie script.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for visit, Patrick! I took your advice to heart when prepping my 
second project report. I can't fix ALL the data, so I ended up only 
fixing issues as I came across them during my annotation processes.  

### Katie
- **One thing I liked** : Such a cool topic! I also like how you really walk through the code so we can understand your process and what's going on. I'm also impressed by how much work goes into the cleaning of the data.
- **One area of improvement** : Will you be doing any machine learning? I understand why you wouldn't, since your task is already so huge! But if you do, an easy(/ier) one would be identifying the gender of the speaker.
- **One thing I learned** : The use of the "partial" function was interesting! A cool way to reuse code.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for the visit, Katie! I like the idea of using machine learning 
to identify gender. If I have time to do this after my other work, I 
will definitely try it out!

### Matt
- **One thing I liked** : Interesting idea. I enoyed Disney, Dreamworks and other related animated movies when I was young, so I can appreciate the content being used. Also, I like the large amount of content being processed as well.   
- **One area of improvement** : Relative file paths should be used instead of the file paths you have now. Gives your filee save/load commands a cleaner look, and makes it so that you can run your code can be run on different machines with little hassle.
- **One thing I learned** : Streamlining multiple different corpora using slightly different methods for each. Also a nice refresher on how to use the re module in python.

#### Cassie's Response:
Thanks for visiting my project, Matt! I've always been a huge fan of 
animated movies, so this corpus makes a sometimes frustrating project a 
little more fun. Also, you're right about the relative file paths. I 
always just copy the path from my directory, and rarely bother to edit 
it in my code. Thanks for the heads up! 

### John
- *One thing I liked:* Your project idea is so. COOL! Also, you are 
approaching this monster of a task very methodically and logically, so 
it's super easy to see what you're going for (especially with your 
regexp). Keep up the great work!
- *One thing that could be improved:* I know you're not finished yet, 
but it would be interesting to see how the data is currently 
conforming/non-conforming to your hypotheses. It's always nice to 
recenter and make sure that you're not missing the bigger picture.
- *One thing I learned:* .sub seems pretty interesting! I'm going to 
need to check that out in the future.
