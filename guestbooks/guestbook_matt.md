# Matt's Project - Have you Reddit? A Reddit Comment Analysis
Hello There! Welcome to my project! Come on in and learn about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise... er the details of my project.

- **What was done well?** I like the project idea! My project also includes some posts from Reddit (but not quite the same volume as yours!). I appreciate the dedication it takes to examine such a large corpus.
- **What can be improved?** I'd definitely give a summary of Reddit terms at the beginning, because I don't know what some of the columns are referring to. Also I think it would be cool to use machine learning to identify the subreddit, but that would be really difficult given the number of subreddits. Maybe something with just the top subreddits or something small!
- **One thing I learned:** I learned how to read in a huge data set in its compressed form, which is definitely very useful.

Thank you for the response. I agree that I should limit the subreddits, I don't have a solid list yet. Also, I will try to put an explanation of subreddit terms into the final product.

### John's post
- *What was done well?*: Overall, great job! I think you walked us through your file modification really well. Also, I would be lying if I said I wasn't impressed by the sheer magnitude of data you've managed to acquire. I wish my files were like that!
- *What can be improved?*: Though I did appreciate your hypotheses in your project_plan.md file, I think you need to specify what you mean by "linguistic trends". Admittedly, I don't know very much about Reddit, but I do know that memes and very unique linguistic patterns profilerate quite rapidly. Perhaps you can see how the origin of a few particular patterns spread across subreddits? Right now, I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for.
- *One thing I learned*: The lzma.open function seems super helpful. Some corpora I've encountered use the .xz file extension and I may need to incorporate this module into a future project! Thanks!

#### Matt's Response

Glad you enjoy what you're seeing. I've moved on to mostly machine learning. I might do some linguistic analysis on the side, but it is no longer the primary aspect.

### John's second post
- *What was done well?*: Clean files with a good level of detail. Modifying your models as you went along really helped me follow your process. I think you're moving in the right direction!
- *What can be mproved?*: I'm not sure if your license is as thorough as it needs to be. Obviously, I'm not an expert on licenses, but what you have right now seems to be very informal and
unrefined. Perhaps look into this more?
- *One thing I learned*: The .isin function seems pretty interesting. It seems to simplifying functions quite a bit -- I'm defintiely going to check that out!

#### Matt's Response

Thanks for the second response, though I think you need to visit two further down the alphabetic list, not the same two people. Anyway, the license is indeed simple looking, but I talked with Na Rae. Apparently, for what I want, the setup I have right now works.

### Eva's post:
- **What was done well**: Helpful comments and explanation throughout your project. I really like the TOC in phase2_exploration.ipnyb. Nice job experimenting with machine learning! Considering the task, I think the accuracy scores you were getting were pretty good.
- **Improvements and suggestions**: Some of your data visualizations are a little small (and that one heatmap turned out kinda impossible to read). Increasing plot size and text size could make the plots easier to read. Might be also useful to use a monochromatic palette for the heatmaps. Currently, the data samples are too big to view on Github, so maybe create a really small data sample just so viewers who aren't necessarily planning on recreating your project can get an idea of what you're working with. One other small thing - there's a couple places in your progress report where the markdown isn't formatted correctly. Make sure to put a space after using a header marker.
- **What I learned**: I learned about some different ways to handle missing/messy data - good job on the data cleanup!

#### Matt's Response

Thanks for the feedback. I agree that I probably should make the heatmaps bigger. The reason the first heatmap, the one for all the subreddits, was not increased, was because the confusion matrix was gigantic, and I couldn't figure out how to render it properly without taking up too much space.

Also, thanks for the heads up on the markdown. My own markdown editor renders them as headers so I didn't catch it
