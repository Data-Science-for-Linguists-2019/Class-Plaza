# Matt's Project - Have you Reddit? A Reddit Comment Analysis
Hello There! Welcome to my project! There's not much to look at at the current moment, I haven't done much since Progress Report 1 due to being strapped for time. Not to worry though, I will get the time to work on it during spring break. Nonetheless, come on in and learn about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise... er the details of my project.

- **What was done well?** I like the project idea! My project also includes some posts from Reddit (but not quite the same volume as yours!). I appreciate the dedication it takes to examine such a large corpus.
- **What can be improved?** I'd definitely give a summary of Reddit terms at the beginning, because I don't know what some of the columns are referring to. Also I think it would be cool to use machine learning to identify the subreddit, but that would be really difficult given the number of subreddits. Maybe something with just the top subreddits or something small!
- **One thing I learned:** I learned how to read in a huge data set in its compressed form, which is definitely very useful.
