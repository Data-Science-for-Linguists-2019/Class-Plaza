# Matt's Project - Have you Reddit? A Reddit Comment Analysis
Hello There! Welcome to my project! There's not much to look at at the current moment, I haven't done much since Progress Report 1 due to being strapped for time. Not to worry though, I will get the time to work on it during spring break. Nonetheless, come on in and learn about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise... er the details of my project.

- **What was done well?** I like the project idea! My project also includes some posts from Reddit (but not quite the same volume as yours!). I appreciate the dedication it takes to examine such a large corpus.
- **What can be improved?** I'd definitely give a summary of Reddit terms at the beginning, because I don't know what some of the columns are referring to. Also I think it would be cool to use machine learning to identify the subreddit, but that would be really difficult given the number of subreddits. Maybe something with just the top subreddits or something small!
- **One thing I learned:** I learned how to read in a huge data set in its compressed form, which is definitely very useful.

- *What was done well?*: Overall, great job! I think you walked us through your file modification really well. Also, I would be lying if I said I wasn't impressed by the sheer magnitude of data you've managed to acquire. I wish my files were like that!
- *What can be improved?*: Though I did appreciate your hypotheses in your project_plan.md file, I think you need to specify what you mean by "linguistic trends". Admittedly, I don't know very much about Reddit, but I do know that memes and very unique linguistic patterns profilerate quite rapidly. Perhaps you can see how the origin of a few particular patterns spread across subreddits? Right now, I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for. 
- *One thing I learned*: The lzma.open function seems super helpful. Some corpora I've encountered use the .xz file extension and I may need to incorporate this module into a future project! Thanks!

### John's second post
- *What was done well?*: Clean files with a good level of detail. Modifying your models as you went along really helped me follow your process. I think you're moving in the right direction!
- *What can be mproved?*: I'm not sure if your license is as thorough as it needs to be. Obviously, I'm not an expert on licenses, but what you have right now seems to be very informal and 
unrefined. Perhaps look into this more?
- *One thing I learned*: The .isin function seems pretty interesting. It seems to simplifying functions quite a bit -- I'm defintiely going to check that out!
