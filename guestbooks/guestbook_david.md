Здравствуйте, товарищи!

## Cassie's Visit
* **One Thing I Liked:** Your file annotations are great! Organized, and 
so informative! You do a great job of explaining each step, acknowledging 
any setbacks you may encounter, and outlining your goals for the future. 
I especially like how you list the next steps of your project at the end 
of your second project report notebook.
* **One Area of Improvement:** Your project's homepage has lots of 
individual files by themselves, which can make navigating the homepage a 
little confusing. Maybe you can consolidate some of these files into 
folders?
* **One Thing I Learned:** The history of this corpus is so cool! And it 
really shows just how difficult salvaging old data can be. Some of this 
data could be reconstructed automatically, but other portions had to be 
constructed manually. The amount of work David and his colleagues have 
put into compiling this data is VERY impressive!
