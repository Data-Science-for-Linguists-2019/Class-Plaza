# Eva's Project: [Blog Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis)
Welcome to my project! For more information about the project, check out [my project plan](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/project_plan.md). If you're interested in looking at some 2004 blogs, check out the [data_samples folder](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/master/data_samples).

Thanks for stopping by! 

### Elena's entries
 - *What was done well*: Your organization and writeup is really well-organized and easy to follow. The investigating you've done with the makeup of the corpus so far is pretty thorough, though I'm looking forward to see what else you'll add in the future! I think this is a really exciting project -- there's a lot that you can do with this, and you've set yourself up nicely here to go in a few different directions.
 - *What could be improved*: I think it would be interesting to look at the gender makeup of the different industries/ages, maybe as a consideration for the future (once you start doing the sentiment analysis). This might be especially pertinent if you're looking at usage of new lexis/linguistic trends, since women are often leaders of linguistic variation. It would be interesting to see if this is true in online language. Another consideration might be to look at the most common words used by gender (whether that's overall, by industry, by age, what have you).
 - *What I learned*: I'm surprised the makeup of bloggers actually skews slightly male! I wonder if that's across the board, or just for the source for this corpus?
