# Eva's Project: [Blog Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis)
Welcome to my project! For more information about the project, check out [my project plan](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/project_plan.md). If you're interested in looking at some 2004 blogs, check out the [data_samples folder](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2019/Blog-Sentiment-Analysis/tree/master/data_samples).

Thanks for stopping by!

 - *What was done well*: Your organization and writeup is really well-organized and easy to follow. The investigating you've done with the makeup of the corpus so far is pretty thorough, though I'm looking forward to see what else you'll add in the future! I think this is a really exciting project -- there's a lot that you can do with this, and you've set yourself up nicely here to go in a few different directions.
 - *What could be improved*: I think it would be interesting to look at the gender makeup of the different industries/ages, maybe as a consideration for the future (once you start doing the sentiment analysis). This might be especially pertinent if you're looking at usage of new lexis/linguistic trends, since women are often leaders of linguistic variation. It would be interesting to see if this is true in online language. Another consideration might be to look at the most common words used by gender (whether that's overall, by industry, by age, what have you).
 - *What I learned*: I'm surprised the makeup of bloggers actually skews slightly male! I wonder if that's across the board, or just for the source for this corpus?

#### What was done well

Terrific exploration of the text and image files! My first thought was to ask why we need the image files when we have the texts, and the preparatory explanation alerted me to the sort of scrutiny that both the text and images merit, and even require.

I know we’re supposed to mention only one thing that was done well, but the box and whisker plots in the BALC cleaning file are exactly the right visualization for the story they need to tell.

#### Area for improvement

Insofar as this was an interim report, and not just a peek at a work in progress, the cells at the bottom of BALC cleaning that generate errors or that haven’t been run might have been removed, or, at least, commented.

#### What I learned
 
This ties into what was done well: even though some of the work seems to have been done for us ahead of time (transcription, categorization, and—at least implicitly—finding and squashing duplication), and even though the project that published the data is fairly mature, we need to verify the data, and not trust it as received. For example, we didn’t check the ETS data for duplicates, and I would (unwisely) have extrapolated from that procedure and not checked BALC adequately.
