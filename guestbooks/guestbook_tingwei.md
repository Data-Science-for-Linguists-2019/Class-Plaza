* __One Good Thing I liked__ : I like your project idea! The idea of creating a spellchecker is an interesting one to be sure, since it is relevant to today. Code is short and straight to the point as well.
* __One area of improvement__ : Your notebooks could use more markdown cells explaining what's going on. Your code is basic enough for now that it's easy to follow, but I foresee this being an issue when you construct a larger notebook for additional features of your project.
* __One thing I learned__ : I've learned an approach to filtering large samples of text using the re library in python.
