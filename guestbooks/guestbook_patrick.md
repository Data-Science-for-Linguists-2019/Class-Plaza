### Katie's post

- **What was done well?** Very good explanations and walking through the code. A lot of it is stuff I've never done before, so I like how it's relatively easy to follow along.
- **What can be improved?** When you get to the point of annotating for sentiment (and you might already be planning this), I'd suggest printing out translated snippets too, just so that the reader can understand the different qualifications fo r the different types of sentiment.
- **One thing I learned:** I learned how to use BeautifulSoup to get text from a webpage, and how complex this can actually be! I'm sure there's a lot of room for small errors, so I appreciate the fact that you made a separate script for each file.
