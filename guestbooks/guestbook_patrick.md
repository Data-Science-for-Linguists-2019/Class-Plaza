### Katie's post

- **What was done well?** Very good explanations and walking through the code. A lot of it is stuff I've never done before, so I like how it's relatively easy to follow along.
- **What can be improved?** When you get to the point of annotating for sentiment (and you might already be planning this), I'd suggest printing out translated snippets too, just so that the reader can understand the different qualifications fo r the different types of sentiment.
- **One thing I learned:** I learned how to use BeautifulSoup to get text from a webpage, and how complex this can actually be! I'm sure there's a lot of room for small errors, so I appreciate the fact that you made a separate script for each file.

* __One thing I liked__ : Decent explanations of code, presents errors in their full glory for all to see. In other words, actually goes over what's wrong instead of trying to hide it.
* __Area of Improvement__ : Presentation - you print out your scraping code, rather than copying and pasting it into a cell (be it code or markdown with syntax highlighting) or uploading the file separately? I fail to see what this accomplishes, if anything makes things worse. Code with plain text fonts just looks ugly and hard to read. I would at the least put it in a markdown cell with syntax highlighting.
* __One thing I learned__ : BeautifulSoup and webscraping. Also, using os change directory in python to navigate to files in a live program
