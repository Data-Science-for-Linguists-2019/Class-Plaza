- Why does [linguist llama](http://lingllama.tumblr.com/) want to be a schwa? (Na-Rae the fake student)
- How do we credit the original data source when it is publicly available for non-commercial research purposes, but we alter it to fit our needs for the specific project? Are we allowed to redistribute any of it, or do we just redirect to the original data source posting? (Katie)
- Literary corpora are typically derived works, that is, constructed from literary sources that are not original with the compiler or editor of the corpus. To what extent can the compiler and editor of a corpus legally or ethically control or restrict reuse of the literary materials in that corpus? (David)
- What are some ways to insure research participant's anonymity and safety when publishing results or data using inherently personal data? E.g. demographics, sociolinguistic background. (Eva)
- Two of "The Four Factors" of fair use are "The nature of the 
copyrighted work" and "The amount and substantiality of the portion used 
in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole." However, the concepts 
of "nature", "amount", and "substantiality" can vary widely depending on 
the subject at hand. Who gets to determine these definitions? And do you 
have any general guidelines about what constitutes a "substantial" 
amount? (John)
